%description
naoqi_dashboard is a GUI for monitoring the state of an ALdebaran robot. It is a
port of pr2_dashboard and shows status information like battery status, joint
temperatures, and joint stiffness, as well as integrating ROS tools like
rqt_console and rqt_robot_monitor.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
